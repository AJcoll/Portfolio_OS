                <h3>// 01_THE_PROBLEM</h3>
                <p>There is a significant digital literacy gap, particularly among older adults. Background research shows this user group faces not only practical but also emotional barriers when interacting with new technology. These barriers often manifest as anxiety, low self-confidence, and a general sense of disorientation. Key challenges revolve around confusing language, a deep-seated fear of making mistakes, and difficulty retaining new information.</p>
                <h4>Project Goals:</h4>
                <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li>Help older users feel more confident about their digital literacy.</li>
                    <li>Create a design that can be used by people of all skill levels.</li>
                    <li>Reduce user frustration when independently addressing tech-related problems.</li>

                <h3>// 02_RESEARCH_AND_DISCOVERY</h3>
                <p>To deeply understand the problem space, we conducted a multi-phase research plan that included competitive analysis, user interviews, and a survey to gather insights from multiple perspectives.</p>
                
                <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
                <p>We reviewed six existing digital literacy products and found a clear market gap. Our analysis revealed that none of the existing tools fully met the combined needs for a free, real-time, and adaptive digital literacy support tool that could effectively guide users.</p>
                
                <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                <p>We conducted 45-minute, one-on-one interviews with two older adults (Jim, 82 and Andres, 57) to uncover their real-world pain points. Three primary themes emerged from these conversations:</p>
                 <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li><strong>Language Confusion:</strong> Participants felt that the language and jargon used by many apps and websites were confusing and alienating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fear of Failure:</strong> Both interviewees mentioned that they actively avoid using certain technologies because they believe they will "mess up" or "ruin" something.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> The combination of confusing language and fear of failure created an overarching feeling of frustration with technology.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Survey of Tech Helpers</h4>
                <p>To gain the perspective of those who provide tech support, we surveyed 25 fellow HCI graduate students about their experiences assisting individuals with low digital literacy. "Frustration" was reported 23 times as the primary emotion observed in the person they were helping. The most effective teaching strategies were identified as patient, step-by-step guidance and hands-on demonstration.</p>

                <p>The data validated our core approach of using plain language and step-by-step guidance. For the final task where one participant quit, some noted that the text instructions felt "too long or dense." This provided a key insight: the primary area for improvement is in breaking down complex instructions into even smaller, more granular steps to reduce cognitive load, potentially incorporating more visual aids.</p>

                <p>The transition to autonomous driving introduces new human-factors challenges, the most critical being the "handoff"âthe moment a car must return control to a potentially distracted human driver. Studies show it can take a driver 8-10 seconds to regain full situational awareness. Current systems often use abrupt, startling alerts that can induce panic rather than focused action. This project reframes the handoff as a conversation between car and driver, guided by the question: How might we design an alert system that a driver can understand intuitively in under 3 seconds?</p>

                <h3>// 02_RESEARCH_AND_STRATEGY</h3>
                <p>I synthesized findings from academic papers, NTSB accident reports involving ADAS failures, and real-world user reviews of current systems. This produced three core insights that became the foundation for the ARC framework:</p>
                <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li><strong>Insight: Abrupt Alerts Cause Panic.</strong> The common "panic alarm" approach is ineffective, leading to cognitive overload.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insight: Drivers Lack a Clear Mental Model.</strong> Most drivers treat the system as a perfect black box, leading to over-trust and lack of preparedness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insight: Visual-Only Warnings Are Insufficient.</strong> An effective system must be multi-modal, engaging sight, hearing, and touch.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on this, I established three design principles for the solution: <strong>Awareness</strong> (proactive & ambient), <strong>Request</strong> (clear & actionable), and <strong>Confirmation</strong> (closed-loop & confident).</p>

                <p>I began with rapid, low-fidelity sketching to explore a wide range of concepts for the instrument cluster. This allowed me to quickly test different layouts before investing time in high-fidelity mockups.</p>
                <!-- <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x450/1F1F1F/EAEAEA?text=Hand-drawn+Sketches" alt="Hand-drawn sketches of interface concepts" class="case-study-image"> -->
                <h4>A Multi-Modal Walkthrough</h4>
                <p>The prototype follows a sequence designed to be a gradual conversation.</p>
                <h5>Phase A: Awareness (T-15 Seconds)</h5>
                <p>The system detects a complex situation ahead. It begins to gently draw the driver's attention back with a soft, pulsing cyan light on the dash and a low, gentle chime.</p>

                <h5>Phase R: Request (T-10 Seconds)</h5>
                <p>The explicit handoff request. The light pulses faster, the screen displays "TAKE CONTROL," and a calm voice prompt says, "Please take control of the wheel."</p>

                <h5>Phase C: Confirmation</h5>
                <p>If the driver doesn't respond, the system escalates with amber lights and a haptic vibration in the wheel. Once they grip the wheel, the system provides positive confirmation with a green light and a clear "YOU HAVE CONTROL" message.</p>
                <img src="./images/arc-system/4 - Urgent.png" alt="Side-by-side comparison of the dashboard in urgent and confirmation states" class="case-study-image">

                <h5>Phase D: Failure</h5>
                <p>If the driver completely fails to respond, the system escalates with orange lights and stronger haptic vibration in the wheel. The vehicle will then begin to slow down and eventually come to a safe stop.</p>

                <h3>// 01_THE_PROBLEM</h3>
                <p>Busy students and professionals struggle to manage their ever-growing lists of tasks, leading to decreased productivity and increased stress. The current market for digital tools is polarized: applications like Todoist focus on simplicity but can lack advanced features, while tools like Notion are highly versatile but present a steep learning curve that can be intimidating. This leaves a significant market gap for a solution that combines robust functionality with intuitive design.</p>
                <h4>Project Goal & Research Question:</h4>
                <p>This project's primary goal was to conduct foundational research to answer the question: How can a technology-based solution solve usersâ lack of productivity and organization due to the limited capabilities of current task management solutions?. The insights gathered would directly inform the design of a new application, "Tasker".</p>

                <h3>// 02_METHODOLOGY</h3>
                <p>We employed a mixed-methods approach to gather rich qualitative data from students and working professionals, conducting two distinct research activities.</p>
                <h4>Remote Observations</h4>
                 <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li>We observed six participants (ages 23-32) performing a series of pre-made task management scenarios over Zoom or in person.</li>
                    <li>Each 20-30 minute session was recorded and transcribed to capture their organic behaviors and challenges when using their current tools.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>In-Depth Interviews</h4>
                <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li>We conducted interviews with six different participants (ages 19-29), screened to ensure they used digital task management tools.</li>
                    <li>The 30-40 minute interviews explored their motivations, frustrations, and ideal features in-depth.</li>
                    <li>Data was transcribed, coded using Atlas.ti, and synthesized using affinity diagrams in FigJam to identify key themes and patterns.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section class="case-study-section">
                <h3>// 03_KEY_FINDINGS</h3>
                <p>Our analysis of 12 user sessions revealed several critical insights into user behavior and frustrations.</p>
                <h4>Finding 1: A Fragmented System is the Norm</h4>
                <p>The most prominent pain point was the frustration of fragmentation.</p>
                <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li>Most participants used multiple applicationsâcommonly Google Calendar for scheduling events, Apple Reminders for deadlines, and Apple Notes for to-do lists.</li>
                    <li>This led to inefficient, multi-step workflows. For instance, some users would first enter tasks in Apple Notes and then switch to Apple Reminders to set a notification for the same task.</li>
                    <li>This constant switching was described as tedious and a waste of time.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Finding 2: Users Need More Customization & Visual Feedback</h4>
                <p>While users often defaulted to simple, pre-installed apps for convenience, they consistently expressed a desire for more features.</p>
                 <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li>Advanced Color-Coding: Four participants specifically mentioned wanting more advanced color-coding options to better categorize tasks by type (e.g., work, school, personal).</li>
                    <li>Clearer Status Indicators: Participants wanted better visual feedback for task completion. They mentioned a desire for features like automatic strikethroughs or the ability to have completed tasks fade in color to provide a clear sense of accomplishment and a cleaner view.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Finding 3: Prioritization is a Major Challenge</h4>
                 <p>Users struggled to manage their priorities, especially when feeling overwhelmed.</p>
                 <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li>Three participants struggled with prioritizing tasks and managing multiple tools at the same time.</li>
                    <li>They found it difficult to carry forward unfinished tasks from a previous day and keep track of upcoming deadlines, which could lead to confusion.</li>
                 </ul>
