                <p>There is a significant digital literacy gap, particularly among older adults. This user group faces not only practical but also emotional barriers when interacting with new technology, including anxiety and low self-confidence. Key challenges often revolve around "confusing language, fear of making mistakes, and difficulty retaining new information."</p>

                    <li>Help older users feel more confident about their digital literacy.</li>

                <p>To understand the problem space, we conducted a competitive analysis, a literature review, and direct user research through interviews and a survey.</p>
                <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
                <p>We reviewed six existing digital literacy products and found a clear market gap: "none of the existing tools fully meet these combined needs of a free, real-time, and adaptive digital literacy support tool."</p>
                <!-- <img src="#" alt="Competitive Analysis Chart" class="case-study-image"> -->
                <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                <p>We conducted one-on-one interviews with two older adults (Jim, 82 and Andres, 57) to uncover their real-world pain points. Three primary themes emerged from these conversations: language confusion, fear of failure, and frustration.</p>
                <blockquote>One participant captured the core emotional barrier perfectly, stating they avoid new technologies because they believe they will "mess up or 'ruin' something."</blockquote>

                <p>The transition to autonomous driving introduces new human-factors challenges, the most critical being the "handoff"âthe moment a car must return control to a potentially distracted human driver. Studies show it can take a driver 8-10 seconds to regain full situational awareness. Current systems often use abrupt, startling alerts that can induce panic rather than focused action. This project reframes the handoff as a conversation between car and driver, guided by the question: How might we design an alert system that a driver can understand intuitively in under 3 seconds?</p>

                <h3>// 02_RESEARCH_AND_STRATEGY</h3>
                <p>I synthesized findings from academic papers, NTSB accident reports involving ADAS failures, and real-world user reviews of current systems. This produced three core insights that became the foundation for the ARC framework:</p>
                <ul class="directives-list">
                    <li><strong>Insight: Abrupt Alerts Cause Panic.</strong> The common "panic alarm" approach is ineffective, leading to cognitive overload.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insight: Drivers Lack a Clear Mental Model.</strong> Most drivers treat the system as a perfect black box, leading to over-trust and lack of preparedness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insight: Visual-Only Warnings Are Insufficient.</strong> An effective system must be multi-modal, engaging sight, hearing, and touch.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on this, I established three design principles for the solution: <strong>Awareness</strong> (proactive & ambient), <strong>Request</strong> (clear & actionable), and <strong>Confirmation</strong> (closed-loop & confident).</p>

                <p>I began with rapid, low-fidelity sketching to explore a wide range of concepts for the instrument cluster. This allowed me to quickly test different layouts before investing time in high-fidelity mockups.</p>
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x450/1F1F1F/EAEAEA?text=Hand-drawn+Sketches" alt="Hand-drawn sketches of interface concepts" class="case-study-image">
                <h4>A Multi-Modal Walkthrough</h4>
                <p>The prototype follows a sequence designed to be a gradual conversation.</p>
                <h5>Phase A: Awareness (T-15 Seconds)</h5>
                <p>The system detects a complex situation ahead. It begins to gently draw the driver's attention back with a soft, pulsing cyan light on the dash and a low, gentle chime.</p>

                <h5>Phase R: Request (T-10 Seconds)</h5>
                <p>The explicit handoff request. The light pulses faster, the screen displays "TAKE CONTROL," and a calm voice prompt says, "Please take control of the wheel."</p>

                <h5>Phase C: Confirmation</h5>
                <p>If the driver doesn't respond, the system escalates with amber lights and a haptic vibration in the wheel. Once they grip the wheel, the system provides positive confirmation with a green light and a clear "YOU HAVE CONTROL" message.</p>

                <blockquote>The most prominent pain point was the frustration of fragmentation. Most participants used at least two digital tools (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Notes) and often a physical tool like a planner to manage their tasks, leading to duplicate entry and a lack of a single source of truth.</blockquote>
