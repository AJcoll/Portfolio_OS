Product Requirements Document (PRD): "The OS Dashboard" Portfolio
1. Introduction
This PRD outlines the requirements for developing a unique, interactive UX/HCI, IT/Cyber, and Development portfolio. Departing from traditional web pages, this portfolio will be presented as a stylized "Operating System Dashboard" or "Digital Forensics Interface," designed to be highly memorable, efficient for recruiters, and a direct demonstration of the owner's skills across multiple disciplines.

2. Goals & Objectives
Create a Memorable & Unique Portfolio: Stand out from standard web portfolios.

Efficient Information Delivery: Allow recruiters to quickly and easily find relevant information about projects and skills within seconds.

Showcase Diverse Skill Set: Clearly demonstrate expertise in UX/HCI, IT/Cyber, and Development without causing confusion or suggesting a lack of focus.

Directly Demonstrate Skills: The portfolio's interface itself should serve as a live example of design, development, and system thinking capabilities.

Maintain Professionalism: Despite the unique theme, the presentation must be polished, legible, and convey a high level of professionalism.

3. Target Audience
Primary: Recruiters, Hiring Managers, and Team Leads in UX/Product Design, HCI, IT/Cybersecurity, and Software Development roles.

Secondary: Industry peers, potential collaborators, and anyone interested in innovative portfolio displays.

4. Key Features & Functionality
4.1. Initial Access Sequence ("Boot-Up")
Requirement: A brief, text-based animation (e.g., green/white text on dark background) that mimics a system boot or data access.

Duration: Must be extremely fast (1-3 seconds max) to avoid frustrating users.

Content: Dynamic display of text like "ACCESSING_PORTFOLIO_DATABASE...", "SYSTEM_INITIATING...", "[Your Name]_PROFILE_ONLINE".

Purpose: Sets the unique, technical theme immediately.

4.2. Main Dashboard Interface (Landing Page)
Requirement: The primary view, designed for quick scanning and navigation.

Visual Style: Dark mode default, high-contrast, modular panels. Subtle, non-distracting animations (e.g., blinking cursors, soft glows on hover, minor "glitch" effects on transitions).

Components:

Top Status Bar: Displays portfolio title ([Your Name] :: Portfolio_OS v1.0), and subtle system status indicators (SYSTEM_NOMINAL, ONLINE, current time/date).

Left Navigation ("Directory Tree"): Persistent sidebar with clearly labeled, clickable links acting as "directories" or "applications":

► PROJECTS_REPOSITORY/ (Top-level, might expand or lead to a page with filters)

    ► UX_DESIGN_MODULES/

    ► IT_CYBER_SOLUTIONS/

    ► DEVELOPMENT_ARTIFACTS/

► ABOUT_ME_FILE/

► RESUME_DOWNLOAD.pdf (Direct download link)

► CONTACT_LOG/

Central "Top Project Widgets" (Hero Section): Three prominent, distinct panels (widgets) on the main dashboard, each showcasing one top project from UX, IT/Cyber, and Development.

Content per Widget:

Clear Category Title (e.g., // UX DESIGN INITIATIVE //).

Project Title (concise and impactful).

One-liner Value Proposition/Hook (1-2 sentences).

Small, compelling thumbnail image or GIF (static or very short loop).

Action Button: [ACCESS_CASE_STUDY] (Clicking this opens the full case study in the main content area).

Right-Side "Skill Monitor" (Optional): A smaller panel displaying key skills using stylized "gauges" or "matrices" (e.g., UX Research [█████], Python Dev [████], Network Security [███]). This is non-interactive.

4.3. Project Repository (Dynamic Content Area)
Requirement: The main central area that dynamically updates based on user interaction (clicking a navigation link or a "Top Project Widget").

Content Display:

Project Lists (when clicking a directory): When a user clicks UX_DESIGN_MODULES/ (or similar), this area displays a list of all projects within that category.

Each project in the list will have: Project Title, 2-3 sentence summary, small key image, and a [VIEW_DETAILS] button to open its full case study.

Full Case Studies (when clicking a project title/button): This area loads the complete, detailed case study for a selected project.

Structure: Standard headings, paragraphs, high-quality images, embedded videos (if applicable), and clear sections (e.g., Problem, Solution, Process, My Role, Results, Learnings).

Styling: Maintains the dashboard theme (fonts, colors) but prioritizes readability for long-form content.

4.4. Other Content Pages
About Me (ABOUT_ME_FILE/): Loads into the central content area, providing your professional story, philosophy, and how your diverse skills converge.

Contact (CONTACT_LOG/): Loads into the central content area, providing clear methods to contact you (e.g., email, LinkedIn, maybe GitHub). Stylized as "communication channels."

4.5. Resume Download (RESUME_DOWNLOAD.pdf)
Requirement: A direct link to download your PDF resume. Should open in a new tab or trigger a download.

5. Technical Requirements
Responsiveness: Fully responsive design for optimal viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Performance: Fast loading times for all assets and content. Smooth, non-laggy animations and transitions.

Front-End Technologies: HTML5, CSS3 (with potentially CSS variables for theme management, or a preprocessor like SCSS), JavaScript (vanilla JS or a lightweight framework like React/Vue/Svelte/Alpine.js for component management and reactivity).

Deployment: Static site hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) for speed and cost-effectiveness.

Version Control: Git/GitHub for collaborative development and version management.

Content Management (Optional/Future): For case studies, consider a headless CMS (e.g., Strapi, Contentful) if you anticipate frequent content updates, or simple Markdown files for initial simplicity.

6. User Experience (UX) Considerations
Intuitive Navigation: Clear information scent. Users should always know where they are and how to get to other sections.

Readability: High contrast, appropriate font sizes, and ample line spacing for long-form content within case studies.

Accessibility: Consider basic accessibility principles (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes where appropriate).

No Puzzles/Barriers: All interactions should be direct and lead to immediate information access. The theme enhances, not hinders, usability.

Visual Hierarchy: Clear distinction between primary and secondary information.

7. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1)
Search functionality within projects.

Advanced animations or 3D elements (beyond subtle 2D effects).

Backend integration (unless a specific feature requires it).

Real-time "system logs" or dynamic content feeds.
